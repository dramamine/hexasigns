### HYPNODROME FAQ

## The music stopped working??
- Check the mixer. 
  - Lights should be on. 
  - Power switches and volume are in the lower right corner.
  - Make sure something is actually sending audio.
- Find the Raspberry Pi. It should have an audio cable (like headphones) plugged in. If it does, try unplugging/replugging the power cable. Music should start after being plugged in for 90 seconds.
- If the Raspberry Pi is broken, plug in another music device.
  - Find a DJ. 
  - Emergency Zune attached to back of hypno controller.
  - Plug in your phone or something.

# The sign stopped working??
- Make sure it's still powered. (One power cable coming from sign case.)
- It might not be getting data from the Raspberry Pi. Try resetting the Pi by unplugging/replugging the power cable.
- If only some strands are unpowered, there are probably some issues with the wires leading from the sign case to the hexagons. Check the cables and make sure the colors are ligned up correctly. Half the wires are colored creatively, the key is: (red = green, white = yellow, blue = black)
- Need to get on the controller's web interface? Wifi hypnodrome (pw: hypnodrome) and navigate to 192.168.1.50 (or whatever the card sez for IP)

## The hypno crontroller stopped working??
- If the theremin stopped working, its OK - probably only Domegod can fix it
- If the music buttons stop working, its OK - make sure music's still playing
- If the controller stops working, call Domegod
- If the laptop goes to the Windows screen, call Domegod
- If nothing's working - go to the Windows desktop and double-click hexeosis.mp4

STEPS LEFT FOR LUSIO
- Turn two 10ft extensions into one 20+ft extension
- Take video of both hexes working at once (possibly in garage)
- Messaging
- Update rpi with latest code & updated ip
- Update rpi to spit out house music at 140bpm (DEFAULT_BPM)
- Switch the 4x4 button grid for something else



HYPNODROME INSTRUCTION MANUAL

Just thought I would reveal the secrets of the hypno controller...
clips - first layer
masks - second layer. only one can be active at a time, press the "mask killer" buttons to remove

theremin effects - When you press one of these orange buttons, the Theremin in the center activates. The Theremin controls the strength of the effects. So, place your hand above the Theremin, move it closer (until it turns red) to strengthen the effects, farther away (yellow - green) to weaken. 

I think this part is the least intuitive, so if you're dome discipling (or just hanging out) and someone's been playing with the controller for awhile, you should ask them "have you figured out the theremin part yet?" To demo it, I made the effects in the 4 corners the most "obvious", so just press one of those to show how the theremin works.

audio reactive - these effects are bass activated
ACID - very trippy effects
mirror corner - mirror effects

HYPNORADIO - this controls the music. each of these is a different playlist. Green is currently active; unlit buttons will stop the music completely.

HOW TO BE A GOOD DOME DISCIPLE
- If nobody's using the controller, go to the pools and ask "who's next?"
- Discovery is the exciting part; don't reveal info that someone could figure out themselves
- It's fun to have the last person who used the controller explain it to the next person
- If kids want to play but they are too short, find something for them to stand on (stool? bins?)
