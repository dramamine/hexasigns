### HYPNODROME FAQ

## The music stopped working??
- Check the mixer. 
  - Lights should be on. 
  - Power switches and volume are in the lower right corner.
  - Make sure something is actually sending audio.
- Find the Raspberry Pi. It should have an audio cable (like headphones) plugged in. If it does, try unplugging/replugging the power cable. Music should start after being plugged in for 90 seconds.
- If the Raspberry Pi is broken, plug in another music device.
  - Find a DJ. 
  - Emergency Zune attached to back of hypno controller.
  - Plug in your phone or something.

# The sign stopped working??
- Make sure it's still powered. (One power cable coming from sign case.)
- It might not be getting data from the Raspberry Pi. Try resetting the Pi by unplugging/replugging the power cable.
- If only some strands are unpowered, there are probably some issues with the wires leading from the sign case to the hexagons. Check the cables and make sure the colors are ligned up correctly. Half the wires are colored creatively, the key is: (red = green, white = yellow, blue = black)
